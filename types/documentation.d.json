For example, \"Radar Gold Copper\" will find the nearest Gold or Copper deposit.\n\nPutting \"AllExcept\" will make the seeker target everything except the given list, basically inverting it. For example, \"AllExcept Player1 Player2\" will target \"Player3\" or \"Player\"4 but not \"Player1\".\n\nThe commands \"Min\" and \"Max\" set the minimum or maximum distance the seeker will target. For example, \"Min20 Max500\" will make the seeker only target objects within 500 studs and more than 20 studs away.\n\nTriggerWhenSeeked will trigger all connected parts every second when the Seek configurable is satisfied\n\n\"TrigMin\" and \"TrigMax\" work the same as \"Min\" and \"Max\" but it's for the trigger signal, trigger signal will only be sent if the above property is true.\n\nPutting \"Sun\" as part of the list will make the seeker automatically target the main stellar body in the system.\n\nGyros also have a property called MaxTorque.
